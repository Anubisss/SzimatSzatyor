                                  SzimatSzatyor                                 
===============================================================================



   SzimatSzatyor is a WoW (World of Warcraft) injector sniffer written in C++.
   A sniffer can log packets which sended by the server and which sended by
the client also. The code using a lot of low-level C Windows API.
   Some words about the project name: szimatszatyor is a
hungarian compound word, in English "szimat" should be "sniff" or "flair" and
"szatyor" should be "bag". This project is a sniffer so that's why I named it
to szimatszatyor because of the szimat =~ sniff. By the way szimatszatyor is
a bag where gas mask is stored (so gas mask bag) and nowadays it's a
fashionable bag which weared by some people.

   Basically szatyor.exe is the injector which injects the DLL (szatyor.dll)
into the client process and szatyor.dll is the sniffer which sniffs the
packets from the client.

*FEATURES:
    - Can target specific WoW clients by name (default is WoW.exe) via pass
      an argument to the injector, usage: szatyor.exe [wow_exe_name]
    - Can detect the targeted WoW process build number so supports
      multiple builds.
    - Can detect if multiple processes have the same
      name (which should be injected) and gives choice which should
      be injected.
    - Can detect if a process is already injected.
    - Dumps packets to a binary file which is can be parsed by
      TrinityCore's WowPacketParser which is available at here:
      https://github.com/TrinityCore/WowPacketParser
    - Dumps packets to a "user friendly" log file which makes possible to
      read the packets without parsing them. This feature is disabled by
      default. Read the "USAGE" section to know how to enable it.

*USAGE:
    - You need szatyor.exe (the injector) and szimat.dll (the sniffer)
      in the same directory. Note: like other (most) sniffers this directory
      can be different than WoW's directory.
    - Start szatyor.exe
      Note: the user which started WoW should start that too, of course 
            admin user is also OK but not needed.
    - That's all. You can start SzimatSzatyor at anytime.
    - If you want to close the sniffer just press CTRL-C or close the WoW.
      Note: CTRL-C works only in fullscreen mode.
    - Log files are created to where SzimatSzatyor is.
    - Create an empty file (name: dump_user_friendly) where the SzimatSzatyor
      is to enable the "user friendly" log format. Just delete (or rename)
      this file if you want to disable it again. You can enable and disable
      (even multiple times) while WoW is running.

WARNING: An injector sniffer (like SzimatSzatyor) is writing into WoW's memory
         at runtime so Warden (anti-cheating tool in WoW) can detect it.
         At this time never detected by Warden and no punishment rewarded.
         I think Blizzard just doesn't care about it,
         it's not really a cheat... :)



COMPILATION:    If you want to compile SzimatSzatyor from the source code
             you have to generate the project files for your compiler with CMake.
                CMake (http://www.cmake.org/) is an extensible, open-source
             system that manages the build process in an operating system
             and in a compiler-independent manner. You can download a GUI
             for your Windows OS and generate project files for example
             your Visual Studio.
                Note that you must compile the project with a 32-bit compiler
             because the sniffer won't work if you compile it in 64-bit mode.
